## üìå Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a passive reconnaissance assessment of Hapuna Financial Ltd, a fintech institution offering savings and loan services. The assessment was designed to identify publicly available information that could potentially expose the organization to cybersecurity threats. Using tools like `theHarvester`, public OSINT sources were queried to discover exposed data. No active scanning was performed.

## üõ†Ô∏èIn the course of this project, several open-source intelligence (OSINT) platforms and threat intelligence communities were leveraged to assess the level of public exposure of Hapuna Financial Ltd. These sources provided passive insights into the organization‚Äôs infrastructure, email footprint, and external reputation.

### The following are the Open-Source Tools used:
- `theHarvester`
- `Shodan.io`- I used this to scan publicly available internet-connected systems associated with Hapuna Fin.Ltd for exposed services and misconfigurations
- `Hunter.io`-This was used to identify Hapuna valid and exposed corporate email addresses across public records and data breaches.
- `crt.sh`- I used this to search for Hapuna SSL/TLS certificates both active and expired, which revealled additional infrastructure.
- `Spyse / SecurityTrails`-This provided me historical DNS, port scanning data, tech stack information, and IP-to-domain mapping to identify potential forgotten or vulnerable assets
- `GreyNoise`- This helped me to find out if any of Hapuna Fin. Ltd IP address is part of known scanning or botnet activity
- `WHOIS`-It helped to provide information about domain name registrations of Hapuna 
- `URL Redirect Checker`- It helped me to tracks and analyzes the full redirect path of some of the URL found 

### Below are some of the Threat Intelligence Platforms I used in the course of this project:
- LinkedIn
- VirusTotal
- Twitter
- AlienVault OTX
- AbuseIPDB
- FS-ISAC, FIRST, CTA, AfricaCERT, ngCERT

## üîçI did some Security Risk Assessment and I category them under Threat, Potential Risk, vulnerabilies also how to mitigate my findings: 

| **Asset Type** | **Examples** | **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|----------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Emails** | `info@hapuna.org`, `careers@hapuna.org`, etc. | Phishing, spoofing, credential stuffing | Use SPF, DKIM, DMARC; train staff |
| **URLs** | `https://career.hapuna-nigeria.org` | Brute-force, data leaks | Enforce HTTPS, secure login |
| **IPs** | `102.135.200.67`, `18.211.102.144`, etc. | DDoS, exposure via Shodan | Use firewalls, Cloudflare, patching |
| **Hosts** | 59 identified | Enumeration, CVE exploitation | Harden services, scan regularly |
| **ASN** | AS13335 (Cloudflare), AS14618 (AWS) | Infrastructure mapping | Mask ASN info, use dynamic hosting |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Threat Classifications

| **Threat Type** | **Risk** |
|-----------------|----------|
| Targeted Phishing | Employee emails + LinkedIn data enable social engineering |
| Infrastructure Recon | IPs, hosts, and SSL certs expose internal layout |
| Brand Damage | Email spoofing or impersonation can reduce trust |
| Credential Reuse | Public email leaks may allow reuse-based attacks |
